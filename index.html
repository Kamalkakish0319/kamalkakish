            <p>I am a Full-Stack Software Developer and AI Engineer with deep experience building automation-first systems across the enterprise. At IBM, I led the development of AI-powered Slack agents, observability dashboards, and platform migrations that eliminated manual toil, accelerated support operations, and democratized access to internal data. My work bridges DevOps, MLOps, and AI Operations using modern stacks like watsonx, React, Spring Boot, Cloudant, DB2, COS, and Kubernetes. At ISS, I specialized in secure video intelligence, object detection dashboards, and SDK/API integrations using tools like Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, and ONVIF.</p>
