            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I‚Äôm a Full-Stack Software Engineer and AI Engineer with deep experience building automation-first systems across cloud infrastructure and enterprise platforms. I specialize in backend development using Java (Spring Boot) and Python, with strong proficiency in frontend technologies like React, Next.js, and Node.js. My work spans intelligent automation, observability engineering, and AI/ML systems integration. At IBM, I led initiatives automating application onboarding, retirement, and support through AI-driven Slack agents, watsonx Orchestrate, and RAG pipelines ‚Äî reducing response time by 10x and eliminating manual SRE involvement. I also architected monitoring dashboards using React, Cloudant, and COS, and migrated enterprise observability systems from Splunk to IBM-native tooling. At Intelligent Security Systems (ISS), I developed real-time computer vision interfaces and SDK/API integrations for physical security platforms. I engineered thermal/mask detection systems, dashboard visualizations for object analytics, and led architecture, implementation, and partner training across multimillion-dollar deployments. My strengths bridge DevOps, MLOps, and AI Ops, allowing me to deliver scalable, intelligent platforms across domains.</p>
